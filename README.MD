Networks are data structures which describe relationships between related entities in the form of nodes and edges. Through network analysis, we can identify organisational structure, person of interest and predict events. However, network data in real life can be large and contain noisy edges which makes analysis computationally expensive and affect the accuracy of analysis tools.  It is thus beneficial to extract the underlying structure of the network, removing spurious connections in the process. My project focuses on the effects of network backboning on community detection accuracy on graphs, which refers to the processing of simplifying complex graphs while retaining salient and important information. This simplification allows us to reduce the computational intensity of a community detection task without compromising too much on the accuracy.
